# Horiseon-Refactor

## Description
The goal of this assignment was to make the web page more accesable using HTML semantic tags, as well as debugging any links not working correctly, condensing any repetative code, and finally to add a title to show on the website tab to describe the sites purpose. In order to meet the criteria asked, I made updates to HTML elements Div with Header, Nav, Main, Section, Aside, and Footer. By replacing the old code with these updated semantic links ensures better accesability for the site. I also condensed classes and elements to make the sheet cleaner and easier to pinpoint the different sections. Finally I updaed the code in HTML to ensure that all links were working as expected.

Below is a screen shot of the working webpage and the project repo.
